in control node, create a new user (any name or user_new in this example): $ `sudo useradd -m user_new`
in control node, change to the user_new: $ `sudo su - user_new` (ensure that '-' is used)
in control node, generate ssh key: $ `ssh-keygen` (go with the default by pressing enter with no password keyed-in)
in control node, copy the ssh key to workstation (remote): $ `ssh-copy-id workstation` (may replace workstation with name@ip_address and require to enter password of remote workstation when prompt)
in control node, now connection to workstation no longer requires password: $ `ssh workstation` (may replace workstation with name@ip_address)
